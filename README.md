### Database
- The application uses SQLite as the database to store user information.
- The Core of the application is words and letters, which are stored in the database to be used in the typing exercises based on the user's preformance and the letters they need to improve.
- Every word is related to the 3 most frequent letters in it and retrieved based on the user's preformance in these letters and the number of times this word was typed by a user.
- The application database has 9000 words all listed in three files:
```
    long.txt
    medium.txt
    short.txt
```
- Moreover, I provided 3 files that contains bad words to be used to filter the words that are not suitable for the application.
- The application uses two scripts to fill the database with the words and to filter the bad words:
```
    addWords.py
    delWords.py
```
- The application uses the Django ORM to interact with the database and retrieve the data needed for the typing exercises.
- The application uses the Django authentication system to handle user registration and login.
- User account contains the user's username, email, password, and the user's preformance in the typing exercises.
```
    Accuracy (percentage of correct letters in the typing exercises)
    Speed (WPM)
    Last typing exercise date
    Accuracy for each letter
```
